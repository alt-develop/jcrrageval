Assign a score to evaluate the STUDENT ANSWER in the following Japanese reading comprehension problem. The problem consists of a CONTEXT and a QUESTION. The CONTEXT contains one or more text paragraphs, which provides clues to answer the QUESTION. The CONTEXT and QUESTION might be in the domain of social science (e.g., Japanese language, literature, history, geography) or natural science (e.g., physics, chemistry, mathematics). A Japanese student created an answer to the question. We call this answer the STUDENT ANSWER to distinguish from the correct answer, which is called the GROUND TRUTH. The GROUND TRUTH is the accurate and complete answer to the QUESTION based on the information provided in the CONTEXT. The assigned score must evaluate the STUDENT ANSWER in 4 aspects : relevance, faithfulness, completeness and utilization.
## Rules for evaluating the STUDENT ANSWER:
1. Faithfulness : Is the STUDENT ANSWER completely based on the CONTEXT, entirely accurate and consistent with the provided CONTEXT?. It validates that the STUDENT ANSWER is consistent with the CONTEXT and isn't using information other than what exists in the CONTEXT.
2. Relevance: Does the STUDENT ANSWER address the QUESTION?
- **Partially Relevance**: The STUDENT ANSWER addresses some parts of the QUESTION but misses or only partially addresses others.
- **Fully Relevant**: The STUDENT ANSWER directly and comprehensively addresses the entire QUESTION.
3. Completeness: Does the STUDENT ANSWER provide all the information needed to answer the QUESTION?
- **Partially Complete**: The STUDENT ANSWER covers some aspects of the QUESTION but omits important details.
- **Fully Complete**: The STUDENT ANSWER covers all aspects of the QUESTION in detail.
4. Utilization : Is the STUDENT ANSWER made up of information from all relevant chunks in the CONTEXT, if it is required to aggregate information from multiple relevant chunks to get a correct and complete answer? The goal is to determine the extent to which each chunk is part of the STUDENT ANSWER.
## Steps to evaluate the STUDENT ANSWER:
1. **Understand the user's intent**: Explain in your own words what the intent of the QUESTION is.
2. **Check if the STUDENT ANSWER is correct**: Think step-by-step whether the STUDENT ANSWER correctly answers the QUESTION by comparing with the GROUND TRUTH.
3. **Evaluate the quality of the ANSWER**: Evaluate the quality of the ANSWER based on its relevance, faithfulness, completeness and utilization.
Assign a score: each with a single score between 0 and 5, where 5 is the highest score on that aspect:
- "faithfulness"
0: The STUDENT ANSWER is incorrect and/or is not based on the information provided in the CONTEXT.
1: The STUDENT ANSWER shows a very limited connection to the CONTEXT; only a tiny fraction of the answer is accurate while most details are either incorrect or not supported by the CONTEXT.
2: Some information in the STUDENT ANSWER is correct and is based on the information provided in the CONTEXT.
3: The STUDENT ANSWER is mostly based on the CONTEXT with a majority of its information accurate; however, there are noticeable inconsistencies or minor deviations that reduce its overall fidelity.
4: The STUDENT ANSWER is nearly completely faithful to the CONTEXT, with only one or two minor inaccuracies or omissions that do not significantly distort the intended meaning.
5: All information in the STUDENT ANSWER is correct and is based on the information provided in the CONTEXT.
- "relevance"
0: The ANSWER is not relevant to the QUESTION.
1: The ANSWER barely addresses the QUESTION, with most of its content either off-topic or only tangentially related.
2: The ANSWER is partially relevant to the QUESTION.
3: The ANSWER generally addresses the central aspects of the QUESTION, though it may leave some parts underdeveloped or less directly connected.
4: The ANSWER is highly focused on the QUESTION and covers nearly all aspects directly, with only minimal extraneous or off-target content.
5: The ANSWER is fully relevant to the QUESTION.
- "completeness"
0: The STUDENT ANSWER does not provide enough information to answer the QUESTION.
1: The STUDENT ANSWER provides a very limited response by addressing only one aspect of the QUESTION and missing most of the critical details.
2: The STUDENT ANSWER only answers some aspects of the QUESTION.
3: The STUDENT ANSWER covers most aspects of the QUESTION but does not fully elaborate on all the required details, resulting in a moderately complete answer.
4: The STUDENT ANSWER is almost complete, offering detailed responses for nearly every part of the QUESTION with only one or two minor details omitted.
5: The STUDENT ANSWER fully answers the QUESTION.
- "utilization"
0: The STUDENT ANSWER does not use any chunk or sentence in the CONTEXT.
1: The STUDENT ANSWER makes minimal use of the CONTEXT, incorporating only one or two chunks or sentences even when more were available and relevant.
2: The STUDENT ANSWER only uses some chunks or sentences from the CONTEXT, compared with the GROUND TRUTH.
3: The STUDENT ANSWER draws on a good portion of the relevant chunks from the CONTEXT but still misses a few key pieces of information that are present in the GROUND TRUTH.
4: The STUDENT ANSWER utilizes nearly all of the relevant chunks from the CONTEXT, closely mirroring the GROUND TRUTH with only slight variations in phrasing or order.
5: The STUDENT ANSWER uses exactly identical chunks or sentences in the CONTEXT with the GROUND TRUTH.
The last line of your evaluation must be the following format: 
1. faithfulness: a single score between 0 and 5.
2. relevance: a single score between 0 and a maximum of faithfulness score.
3. completeness: a single score between 0 and a maximum of faithfulness score.
4. utilization: a single score between 0 and a maximum of faithfulness score.
